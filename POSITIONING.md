# PAISS - Positioning & Strategy

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21
**Purpose:** Context about Martijn and PAISS business positioning

## About Martijn

**Background:**
- CS degree (though considers most of it outdated)
- Core strength: **Rapid learning and adaptation**
- On the bleeding edge of new technology
- Primary skill: Using AI (especially Claude Code) to build and automate quickly

**Current Position:**
- Early-stage, building portfolio (still very small)
- Uses AI to automate processes and build solutions fast
- Programming languages/tech stacks are secondary - AI handles implementation details
- Can build websites, systems, automations in very short timeframes

**Future Vision:**
- Help companies rethink, recreate, and automate their processes
- Combine automation with AI solutions
- Not traditional developer work - more about **shipping outcomes fast**
- Project-based model: solve one problem → send invoice → move on

**What Makes This Different:**
- Not selling technical expertise in a specific stack
- Not selling years of "AI/ML experience"
- Selling: **Speed, adaptability, and pragmatic solutions**
- Value prop: "I can solve your problem this week instead of next quarter"

## Business Model

**Services:**
- Website development
- Process automation
- AI integration/solutions
- Whatever the client needs (adaptability is the strength)

**How It Works:**
1. Client has a problem
2. Build the solution (using AI-native approach)
3. Deliver quickly
4. Send invoice
5. Move to next project

**Not Offering:**
- Long-term retainers
- Ongoing maintenance contracts (unless explicitly requested)
- Traditional "agency" relationships

## Positioning Strategy

### Core Message
"Ship solutions in days, not months using AI-native development"

### Key Differentiators

**✅ LEAN INTO:**
- **Speed** - "This site? Built in hours. Your project could be next."
- **Pragmatism** - "Working solutions over perfect code"
- **Honesty** - Early-stage, still building portfolio, but can deliver
- **Flexibility** - Tech stack agnostic, AI-powered adaptability
- **AI-Native** - Not learning to use AI, already fluent in it

**❌ AVOID:**
- Pretending to have decades of experience
- Locking into specific technologies ("React specialist")
- Corporate agency speak
- Lengthy case studies that don't exist yet
- Over-promising or hiding the fact that portfolio is small

### Target Audience
- Startups needing things built fast
- Small businesses wanting automation
- Companies with specific process problems
- Decision-makers who value speed over "proven track record"

---

## Website Strategy

### Goals (Priority Order)
1. **Brand awareness** - Establish presence and positioning
2. **Portfolio building** - Show work as it grows
3. **Lead generation** - Get project inquiries

### Suggested Structure

**Minimal Landing Page:**
1. **Hero** - Bold claim about speed/pragmatic AI-powered delivery
2. **What I Do** - Broad categories (websites, automation, process optimization)
3. **How It Works** - Simple 3-step process: Problem → Build → Invoice
4. **Recent Work** - 1-2 examples (quality over quantity, even simple projects count)
5. **About** - 2-3 sentences on approach (not biography)
6. **Contact** - Low-friction (email + optional Calendly)

**Optional Meta Touch:**
Small credibility signal: *"Built this site with AI in X hours. Imagine what we could build for you."*

### Content Principles
- **Keep it short** - Early-stage means less is more
- **Show, don't tell** - Actual work > empty promises
- **Be honest** - "Building this business the way I'll build your solution"
- **Focus on outcomes** - Not tech, not process, just results

---

## Why This Works

**Traditional Model (Dying):**
- Developer with deep expertise in one stack
- Sells time/expertise in that specific technology
- Competes on "years of experience"

**AI-Native Model (Emerging):**
- Operator who leverages AI to ship fast
- Sells outcomes and speed
- Competes on adaptability and delivery velocity

**The Bet:**
In 2025+, **adaptability + AI fluency > deep technical expertise in one stack**

Most traditional developers are still figuring out how to use AI.
Martijn is just... using it. That's the edge.

## Future Considerations

**As Portfolio Grows:**
- Add case studies with actual metrics ("Built in 3 days, saved client 40 hours/month")
- Potentially niche down if pattern emerges (e.g., "AI automation for e-commerce")
- Could add blog/resources showing approach

**Business Evolution:**
- May discover specific types of projects that fit best
- Could transition to hybrid model (projects + selective retainers)
- Might build products/tools for specific industries

**For Now:**
Keep it simple, ship fast, build portfolio, stay adaptable.
